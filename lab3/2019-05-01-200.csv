5^Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith says he has no pity for escaped prisoners, Olatungi Denbow and Michael Findley, who released a video at the weekend claiming their innocence.And he warned persons aiding and abetting the fugitives that they were also breaking the law.In a CNC3 television interview on Monday, Griffith said the individuals had a right to claim their innocence, but that would not be decided by social media but by the criminal justice system.Griffith said, Nothing has changed. it is right of the individuals to claim their innocence. That is going to be decided not by WhatsApp, social media or the Commissioner of Police but by the criminal justice system and that is how it would take place. But what I do find very interesting is the situation whereby the individuals have some degree of support by other individuals who seem to be guiding them accordingly. And I will pursue these individuals because I see them as enemies of the State at this time. They are fugitives and those individuals who are aiding and abetting these escaped fugitives they will also be hunted down because they are also committing a crime.Griffith noted that under Section 5 of the criminal law any person who is aiding and abetting an individual from being held, knowing that person is a convict and an escaped fugitive, was also breaking the law and liable to 10 years imprisonment.Findley, he said, was charged with murder, attempted murder, possession of firearm, ammunition, larceny, robbery, drugs and other offences. Denbow, he said, had similar charges.Responding to the three-minute-long video, Griffith said, This Commissioner of Police, I am making it very plain. I do not care, that is not my business, that is not my concern, there is a criminal justice system and the court will decide whether they are guilty or innocent. They can sing from now to high heaven it is irrelevant to me and irrelevant to the police service. We will hunt you down and we will bring them to justice and let the court decide.Griffith appealed to anyone with information to contact the police at 999, 555, 911, 800-TIPS or any police station or via text/WhatsApp to 482-GARY (4279).And he would consider liaising with Crime Stoppers to double the reward, he said.Crime Stoppers is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the recapture of the two prison escapees. The offer was posted on the Facebook page of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Friday evening.In the video, the escaped prisoners called on Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley and Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC to help them with their plight.The men said they were not armed and dangerous.The men were among eight prisoners who cut through metal bars and removed ventilation blocks at the remand section at Golden Grove Prison, Arouca, on Wednesday.Six others were recaptured between Wednesday night and Thursday.^Carolyn Kissoon^"

10^POLITICS very well may have been the reason behind why the multi-million dollar lawsuit against former Petrotrin chairman Malcolm Jones was discontinued by the State.And even though there is also a possibility that it was not, the government has to come clean and should provide the relevant information to the public to dispel any speculation that politics was at work when the decision was made.Five Law Lords of the London-based Privy Council all agreed on this position Monday as they delivered a ruling in favour of political activist Ravi Balgobin Maharaj against Petrotrin.Maharaj was seeking disclosure of two witness statements that were filed in arbitration proceedings between Petrotrin and World GTL Inc and World GTL St Lucia Ltd. The contents of those statements, given by Petrotrin employees Charmaine Baptiste and Anthony Chan Tack, were what was taken into consideration by British Queens Counsel Vincent Nelson before he advised the newly elected Peoples National Movement (PNM) government in October 2015 that the case against Jones should be discontinued.But even before that advice was received, government publicly stated that the claim against Jones was headed in the direction of being dropped.It appears to the Board that as the available evidence stands at the moment, there are some grounds for thinking that the decision to abandon the claim against Mr Jones may have been influenced by political factors.This is in view of the comments reportedly made by a government minister on 8 and 9 October 2015, in advance of receipt of the written advice of 11 October 2015 from Mr Nelson QC, indicating that the claim against Mr Jones was likely to be abandoned; the very summary and tentative consideration given to the merits of the claim against Mr Jones in that written advice (in particular as compared to the previous detailed advices of counsel when the claim was commenced), on the basis of which Petrotrin seems to have been willing to abandon the claim without further review and the appearance of involvement of the Attorney General of taking that decision, the judgment read.Nelsons advice was there is a reasonable likelihood that a judge will be persuaded that there was a bad business decision but no negligence.But during the hearing of the appeal, the Board questioned why exactly would the State discontinue a US$97 million lawsuit based only on just one paragraph of legal advice.The announcement that the decision had been made to withdraw the claim against Jones came in February 2016 by Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi.The Privy Council Board, comprising Lords Wilson, Hodge, Arden, Kitchin and Sales, stated a significant public interest was attached to the case and disclosure should be made by the State to secure transparency and accountability in relation to the decision.It pointed out that on October 8, 2015, Jones was appointed by the ruling PNM government to the Cabinet Standing Committee on Energy and that it was also on October 8 and 9 that the Minister of Communications stated the case against Jones was headed in the direction of being dropped.So far as concerns possible benefits for the public interest of disclosure of the Baptiste and Chan Tack statements, the Board considers that it is arguable that they are of significant weight, with a view to securing transparency and accountability in relation to relevant decisions in a number of respects. Without seeking to be in any way exhaustive, the Board refers to the following possible public interest benefits of disclosure:(a) to enable the public to understand and, if appropriate, criticise decisions taken by Petrotrin in embarking on the joint venture and in entering into the guarantee which have proved to be so costly to it.(b) to enable the public to be fully informed about those matters and Mr Joness involvement in them so that they could, if appropriate, criticise or oppose the appointment of Mr Jones to roles within government with a focus on energy matters, such as his appointment as a member of the Cabinet Standing Committee on Energy.(c) to enable the public to understand, and if appropriate criticise, the decisions to bring the civil claim against Mr Jones in the first place and then to abandon it.Nelson was also the attorney who advised the previous Peoples Partnership administration to initiate the claim against Jones for failure to take proper care in the conduct of Petrotrins business and for breach of fiduciary duty.He claimed that at the time he gave the advise to initiate the proceedings, he had not had sight of the two statements.Nelson is currently charged with three corruption-related offences that involved the alleged kickback of millions of dollars in legal fees to former attorney General Anand Ramlogan, SC, and former United National Congress (UNC) senator Gerald Ramdeen during the tenure of the Peoples Partnership government between 2010 and 2015.The kickbacks were allegedly gifts for him being granted State briefs by Ramlogan while he was attorney general.Nelson has since agreed to plead guilty to the offences before a High Court judge. His matter will be heard before Justice Malcolm Holdip at the Port of Spain High Court on June 4.Ramlogan, who was one of the attorneys representing Maharaj before the Privy Council, has also been charged alongside Ramdeen for allegedly accepting the payments from Nelson.Maharaj had made a request for the statements under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) but Petrotrin refused to disclose it, citing confidentiality. Following this, Maharaj filed an application for leave to pursue judicial review proceedings but his application was denied at both the High and Appeal Court.The effect of the Privy Council ruling is that Maharaj is now allowed to file his claim for judicial review at the High Court against Petrotrins refusal to disclose the statements.That lawsuit against Jones was filed in 2013 and had arisen following a failed joint venture between Petrotrin and World GTL to build, finance and operate a gas-to-liquids plant in this country.Petrotrin was seeking close to $2 billion in compensation from Jones. On August 4, 2017, he died at the Augustus Long Hospital in Pointe-a-Pierre after ailing for sometime.^Rickie Ramdass^"

17^IN the past few months Jamaicans, Kingstonians in particular, have been struggling with a serious, serious problem. In many households we turn on our pipes expecting to see water, but to paraphrase an old folk song: nuh water nuh deh!The water crisis continues to plague us. Year after year, when the dry season comes around, we find ourselves in the same preckeh. Well, here goesa few tips from the Not-so-happy homemakers guide to living with no water:Do: Think about all the bills you have to pay, and when you erupt into tears, use said tears to wash your face and clean teeth. Not enough tears? Wait until you see a neighbourhood pipeline broken by roadworks. As you watch all that water running to waste on the roadway, that is bound to get your tear ducts flowing again.Dont: Do not forget to close the bathroom door at work in case you need to hold a fresh. Inappropriate, some would say. However, some jobs require you to take home your work, so maybe you can bring some homework to the job. The human resources manager may frown upon your personal care routine, but it is better for your co-workers if you can keep down the funk.Do: Reach for the wipes, perfume, cologne, or air freshener now that the sun has decided to tun-up di heat on us. How come the last few days feel like the middle of August? If you use the air conditioner at home and in the car you will be ready to bawl when the bill comes. (Look back at the first Do.)Do: Make contact with your family in country, especially if they live on the north coast. Officials are telling us that the northern side of island has water in abundance. Invite the cousins to come visit you in town and let them know, no need to bring the hamper with the fruit and vegetables this time. Beg them to carry two drum-pan of water instead.Dont: Do not waste the likkle water youve been hoarding. Bright and powerful businessmen sing the praises of trickle-down economics. Now is the time to practise trickle-down showering. Granny used to say in the evenings that she was going to wash-up. The problem now is wash-up leads to too much splashing. Stretch that cup of water by working from top to bottom.Do: Seize an opportunity. For those who like to party, heres a chance for a new and exciting concept. Host a dirty laundry party at the townhouse pool. Eat, dance, drink, and scruups-scruups the afternoon away. Remember to keep your delicates out of the jacuzzi; they dont do well in the hot water.Do: Label or organise your bottles of liquid. A friend of mine once had a very exciting breakfast when she grabbed the wrong bottle in the kitchen. Based on her telling of the story, I dont think the fancy mixologists/bartenders are ready to serve up a new morning cocktail. Liquor and oats porridge were not a good combination!Do: Be creative. Dust on your car may seem unsightly. Writing please wash me is so out of style. Get with it, man! Draw or write something interesting that will catch a taxi drivers eye, and then perhaps they may stay in line behind you, instead of trying to run you off the road.Are you finding any of these tips helpful? Truth be told, when you have no water at all its hard to see the lighter side. Im not making fun of misfortune, but sometimes wi haffi tek bad sinting mek laugh. Seriously, though, we do have to change our habits. We must be mindful of how we use the resources around us. Our officials have suggested and proposed ways in which our water woes will be eased. Most of the plans are long-term, including laying pipes, replacing mains, and installing pumping stations  all very necessary as our cities and towns continue to expand. In the meantime, while we wait for those plans to materialise, we the citizens can make water conservation an all-year-round habit.Barbara Gloudon is a journalist, playwright and commentator^Barbara Gloudon^undefined^2019-05-20 18:58:44^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"Nuh water nuh dehbut

18^THE Governments penchant simply to announce fait accompli decisions without public input and with minimum information was again on display last week.First, at a reception for a delegation from Shanghai, China, Port of Spain Mayor Joel Martinez announced that the main business section of Charlotte Street, from Park Street to Independence Square, is to be officially designated Chinatown. Next came an announcement from Housing Minister Edmund Dillon that the Government has contracted Chinese firm, China Gezhouba International Engineering Company Ltd (CGGC), to build about 5,000 housing units across the country, beginning with 204 low to mid-income apartments at South Quay, Port of Spain and another 235 at Lady Hailes Avenue in San Fernando.Apart from the sparse information provided in the announcements, the public knows nothing about either project. In the case of the housing contract no details were provided on whether it went out for tender, how the expansion of housing further south of the city fits into a development plan for the regeneration of Port of Spain or how the errors made in nearby housing projects which have helped to fuel crime, for example, are being taken into account.In the case of the plan to designate Charlotte Street as Chinatown, Mayor Martinez said it was all part of the twinning of Port of Spain with Shanghai under Chinas Belt and Road Initiative. According to him, it will create an ideal environment for developing new cooperation techniques, exchange of experiences as well as joint reflections on specific issues that will find solutions and bring improvements.What exactly this means is anybodys guess. The only specific detail known about this is that the entry and exit points at Park Street and Independence Square will be marked by the name on arches to be built by Shanghai Construction. It remains unknown what considerations, if any, Mayor Martinez had taken into account in making this decision nor which interests, if any, he had consulted in doing so.It is true that several Chinese immigrants launched their business careers on Charlotte Street. It was at #31 Charlotte Street, for example, that a 20-year-old Carlton Mack took up a job as a grocery attendant with a small Chinese business, Allums Kwong Hing Co Ltd, from where he blazed a trail that spawned the supermarket and land development empire known today under the JT Allum brand.However, it is also the street where many migrants - from rural sugar estates, from islands notably the eastern Caribbean, the Middle East, and elsewhere put down roots in vending, trading and other forms of commerce. As one of the oldest streets in the capital, it is also at the corner of what is today Charlotte and Independence Square that the Spanish Governor Chacon constructed Government House.The history of Charlotte Street warrants its recognition as a heritage location but, unfortunately, nothing of its rich past is communicated by declaring it another of the worlds Chinatowns as if the sum of its being is as an enclave of one strand of its history.The proposed designation of Charlotte Street and the housing plan for South both require public consultation.^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 18:58:47^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/10/410f1484-2337-11e8-bb31-277e215e09e6/5aa1e025dfd39.image.jpg?resize=400%2C307^"Consultationplease

19^Right is right, even if no one is doing it; wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it. Augustine of Hippo (350-430 AD)I AM disappointed at the headline the Observer newspaper put to its story on Monday, April 29, reporting the declaration of Anglican Bishop Howard Gregory of the position of his church on abortion. Addressing the 149th Synod of Anglican Church in Jamaica, he declared the church must affirm the sanctity of life in order to advance an understanding of the issue of abortion as it affects people and families.  The church forbids abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection, or for any reason of mere convenience.Bishop Gregory then qualified his statement by explaining that the Anglican communion allows consideration of abortion only under specific circumstances, including cases of rape or incest, cases in which a mothers physical or mental health is at risk, or cases involving foetal abnormalities.To this declaration, the Observer put the banner headline: Yes to abortion, and as the subsidiary headline: Anglican Church declares support but not for convenience.This is fake news, and the lowest form of propaganda journalism! The two headlines are the exact opposite of what Bishop Gregory actually said. Truthful headlines would have been No to abortion; Anglican Church declares support only in rare cases.This debate, which long ago turned ugly, already counts truth as a casualty.The pro-abortionists can hardly take comfort in Bishop Gregorys words. They want abortion on demand for any inconvenient pregnancy, in fulfilment of something they call reproduction rights, which is Orwellian doublespeak, for what they really want is the right not to reproduce.It is a logical consequence of the sexual revolution, which converted what was always portrayed as an act of love between a man and a woman in a committed relationship leading to procreation, into a sensual and consensual act of recreation, really mutual masturbation; when pregnancy results, which was never in the plan, the hedonists call for the right to abortion to avoid the burden and expense of at least two decades of child-rearing.What is at root is the wish for sexual intercoursein any orificeto be disconnected from a committed family relationship, and to become like tennis, chess, or swimming: a matter of recreation.What is in the way of this new (im)morality is that sexual intercourse between a healthy man and a healthy woman is open to pregnancy, and so technology has to be brought into play to avoid the inevitable consequences. And this is the inconvenient truth: abortion is being proposed as the mechanism by which people can avoid the consequences of their free choices. Abortion allows free agents to avoid responsibility for their free choices. Abortion promotes irresponsibility.If a man and a woman make a free decision to have sex, then they must be prepared to live with the consequences. This is maturity. The state must not encourage people to avoid their responsibilities; this would be promoting indiscipline.In his charge to the Synod, Bishop Gregory chided traditionalists who are doctrinaire on the sanctity of life when the issue of abortion comes up, but support capital punishment; such people, he said, could not call themselves pro-life. I agree! My own denomination is as opposed to capital punishment as we are to abortion.Nevertheless, I am disappointed at the contradictory stance taken by Bishop Gregory; if the Anglican Church is pro-life, then it must take its position to its logical conclusion: one cannot support the taking of innocent human life in any circumstance.We Christians do not see death as evil, but as a transition from one kind of life to another; and therefore we cannot play off the life of the mother against the life of the child, or decide that foetal abnormalities deserve a sentence of death. What then of inconvenient mentally ill family members?Jamaica Gleaner^Peter Espeut^undefined^2019-05-20 18:58:48^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"Abortion promotes irresponsibility

As a child my grandmother patched our clothing until the entire piece of clothing seemed like it was made of a patch quilt. People who grew up knowing what it is to be hungry or to treat a meal with meat as a Sunday special have trouble throwing away ends of bread or leftovers.On the other hand, people who never knew what it is to be poor, hungry or in need cannot understand the plight of those struggling for survival.

32^The Parliament last Friday approved President Paula-Mae Weekes notification of the nomination of attorney Roger Mark Kawalsingh as a member of the Police Service Commission (PSC).However, the motion to approve his appointment, which was moved by Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley, was met with heat in the Parliament sitting, as Rowley delivered a tongue lashingsaying Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar was supportive of Kawalsinghs nomination when she was consulted by President Weekes, but the weather changed when Kawalsingh became a legal adviser to State witness Vincent Nelson.A total of 21 Government members voted in favour of the nomination.Rowley and Government members shouted: Shame! when 11 Opposition members abstained.In 2017, Nelson, a Jamaican Queens Counsel, sued the attorney general for $10 million in unpaid legal fees. Kawalsingh is part of Nelsons legal team.Nelson is now the chief witness in the corruption case against former attorney general Anand Ramlogan and former Opposition senator Gerald Ramdeen.The prime minister appeared visibly angry over Naparima MP Rodney Charles totally unfounded conspiracy theories which, he said, are aimed to undermine the States prosecution of Ramlogan and Ramdeen.Beyond reproachRowley reprimanded Charles for attempting to put a defence on the Hansard for people charged before the criminal court, saying the Parliament will have none of it.This is an insult to the presidency and to the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago, he said, as he criticised Persad-Bissessar for supporting Charles.He said Kawalsingh had worked with Persad-Bissessar in chambers.When the president consulted, my advice is that my colleague from Siparia was very happy, and she gushed finally one of us will be on the commission.It was okay then, but something happened since then to have caused this reverse and opposition, Madam Speaker. And I dare say in my own analysis the only thing that has happened since then is today Kawalsingh is Vincent Nelsons lawyer.Rowley said Kawalsingh is a person with integrity beyond reproach, so much so among his peers he is a member of the disciplinary committee. The minute a criminal matter comes out of the political management of the company and goes to the court and he is the advocate and has been so for this person, all of a sudden Kawalsingh bad.He said the president would have done her thorough investigation of Kawalsingh.Stand scrutinyHe said he knows of no situation where Kawalsingh is under investigation, or that he is part of a basket of lawyers under probe, as implied by Charles.The prime minister said Section 122 of the Constitution speaks to a Police Service Commission which shall consist of a chairman and four other members, as he dismissed Charles argument that there are four members in place and other issues facing the nation should be dealt with.He noted Charles assertion that everyone who achieves high office must be able to stand scrutiny.The prime minister said newly appointed United National Congress (UNC) Senator Ashvani Mahabir has questions to answer.He recalled when he was a Peoples National Movement (PNM) backbencher he made a case for Caroni workers who lost all their money in the Hindu Credit Union during the CLICO bailout debate.Describing Mahabirs appointment as offensive, Rowley said one of the major players in the Hindu Credit Union calamity, who failed to turn up before a commission of enquiry, is now sitting in the Parliament.Opposition chief whip David Lee said the prime minister was imputing improper motives against a senator.House Speaker Bridgid Annisette-George overruled and asked the prime minister to continue.Only crimeRowley noted Kawalsinghs notification came to the House since April 23, and he had to sit and listen to the mischievous comments of Charles, who had asked what was the urgency of this matter.Rowley said his Government has no problem in supporting Kawalsinghs nomination.He said Kawalsinghs only crime is that he is the lawyer of a citizen of another country who decide to come to Trinidad and Tobago to tell the truth.The only thing that disqualifies Mr Kawalsingh is that he is providing legal advocacy to a person who has turned State witness.That should tell this country what standards are being set by the UNC in Trinidad and Tobago and to come into the Parliament and try to impose that standard on our people.If there is anyone who is disqualified from holding high office in this country is not Kawalsingh, its all of them on the UNC bench, said Rowley.^Anna Ramdass^"

33^A judge is urging the Commissioner of Police to ensure that disciplinary measures are implemented against police complainants who acted maliciously in the discharge of their mandate.Justice Frank Seepersad made the comment in ruling in favour of roofing contractor Sherwin Thompson, who the court found on Wednesday was maliciously prosecuted.Thompson, 46, had been charged with the possession of three rounds of ammunition. The case was dismissed back in 2013.Presiding in the San Fernando Supreme Court, Justice Seepersad said that the court must condemn the abuse of authority. He said when claims for malicious prosecution are successful, the awards are paid from the public purse which, instead of being used to address societal needs, improve infrastructure or purchase medication, has to be diverted to pay damages.Errant police officers must be made to account. It cannot be business as usual. The abuse of authority erodes public trust and confidence in the service and, given the heightened levels of crime, an all hands on deck approach is required and co-operation between citizens and the police is mandatory, but such a partnership is premised on trust.He urged the Commissioner of Police to ensure that disciplinary measures are implemented against complainants who have been found to have acted maliciously in the discharge of their mandate.The caseIn court documents, Thompson, who is also a plumber, said that at 3 p.m. on July 25, 2011, he went to the Point Fortin police station as a condition of bail.He saw Constable Shiva Hosein and the officer told him he (Hosein) had information that Thompson knew the whereabouts of a person known as Sugars.Thompson told him he knew nothing about that man and that Hosein responded: Alright, is so yuh want it?Thompson said around 4 p.m. that day, officers in uniform arrived at his home and did not identify themselves or their purpose.He said they searched him and two other men who were at his house. Nothing illegal was found. They also searched under Thompsons house and took him inside but again nothing was found.Thompson said as the officers were leaving, Hosein went back under the house and called out to him. While they were standing together, the officer dropped a black packet on the ground between them. Thompson said he was grabbed and handcuffed by Hosein and another officer, and later charged with possession of ammunition.Remained in custody more than two yearsAt the end of the matter in 2013, at the Point Fortin court, the case against Thompson was dismissed.He sued for damages for malicious prosecution, for aggravated and exemplary damages and interest and cost. He was represented by attorneys James Philbert, Carl Mattis, Che Cupid and Keisha-Marina Bostic.The State was represented by attorneys Neil Byam and Rondelle Hinds.In court documents, Hosein said that he and other officers went to Thompsons home with a search warrant. He said that Thompson and two men and the house were searched.The officer said that downstairs, in a black bag under lumber, one shotgun cartridge and two .9mm cartridges were found.In court documents, Hosein denied that he questioned Thompson about Sugars.Seepersad found that Thompson and his witness were credible and that malice was involved in Thompsons arrest by the police.Judgement was found in Thompsons favour. Assessment for damages is to be done before a master of the court.Seepersad said that in this country the abuse of authority at every level is apodictic and abhorrent.Police officers are vested with authority which must be exercised in the discharge of their mandate to protect and serve. This mandate relates to the public interest, not their own insular concerns, and should never be engaged in a manner which violates the enshrined rights of citizens. As the guardian of the Constitution, the court must jealously guard citizens rights and must condemn the abuse of authority, he said.^Nikita Braxton-Benjamin^"

35^A HARDWORKING and humble man who started a small business selling clay blocks which grew into an empire.This was how Hubert Bhagwansingh was described yesterday as hundreds gathered to pay their final respects to founder and chairman of the Bhagwansinghs Group of Companies.Bhagwansingh died last Sunday after ailing for some time. He was 84.Delivering the eulogy at his funeral service at the Aramalaya Presbyterian Church in Tunapuna, Bhagwansinghs granddaughter Ariana Bhagwansingh-Ragoo noted that her grandfather was well known for his business acumen.Bhagwansingh, with his wife Helen, built Bhagwansinghs Hardware and Steel Industries Ltd with its first location in Port of Spain.The business was successful and led to the opening of other outlets in Chaguanas, Marabella and Trincity.From Bhagwansinghs Hardware, the business grew with the acquisition of Dansteel Ltd, Rainbow Construction Ltd and Central Trinidad Steel Ltd among other entities.But, Bhagwansingh-Ragoo said, her grandfathers love for business was accompanied by an even greater love for people.She said he was at the helm of several housing projects aimed at providing affordable housing for low income families.He was kind, generous, jovial and a loving husband, father and grandfather.Bhagwansingh-Ragoo shared memories of Bhagwansingh treating his staff to doubles and sno cones, saying he showed perpetual appreciation for his staff. She said his legacy would live on.Officiating the ceremony, Rev Adrian Sieunarine lauded Bhagwansinghs humanitarian actions and generosity.He was hardworking. He was humble. He came from humble origins and he reminded himself about that and he reminded others. Struggle and sacrifice and service were his way of life. He was gifted with a sense of humour to put our lives in perspective. Hardworking, humble, humourous. That was Hubert.Sieunarine said Bhagwansingh will not only be remembered for building projects but for building people.When we think of Mr B we think of building. He built his life, he built the lives of the people around him, he built churches, he built communities...he was always building. He always had an eye for what could be improved whether it was a building, a piece of land, a project or a person.He said Bhagwansinghs legacy would be remembered by generations to come.^Camille Hunte^"

50^LAST weeks prison break has once again put the spotlight on the glaring failures to fully secure the nations jails.Good police work quickly led to the capture of six of the eight escapees, seven of whom are charged with murder, including one who is on 64 charges associated with the heinous murder of three persons including a 14-month-old baby, and the kidnapping of two young women. Those women who are now witnesses for the State, experienced extreme terror on learning that one of their torturers had escaped.To make matters worse, it took hours for the police to check in on them after wasting valuable time at the wrong house.How eight prisoners could have escaped from Remand Yard at the Golden Grove Prison in Arouca was a mystery until it was revealed that all eight were crowded into one cell, allowing a level of collusion in the cutting of two bars and the removal of a large brick to create a space of about two feet. Through this impossibly small space, eight men were apparently able to escape their cells and somehow duck the entire security system at the prison compound, scale two perimeter fences and disappear into the darkness between Tuesday night and dawn on Wednesday. Fortunately, their freedom was short-lived. Five were recaptured within hours with a sixth held the next day. All were caught in the Las Lomas area. Two remain at large with a $50,000 reward offered by Crime Stoppers for information leading to their recapture.In this period of high crime, a prison break is the last thing the country needs. In addition to fuelling fear among the public, it also consumes scarce police resources which are diverted from other matters to deal with the emergency.One expects that the Commissioner of Prisons and the Minister of National Security have both launched investigations into how such an incident could have happened and that both will soon account to the public for the lapse and outline how they plan to ensure it does not happen again.Planning for better policing at the nations prisons was announced as a high priority measure last year following a visit to the Maximum Security Prison at Golden Grove by National Security Minister Stuart Young and Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith following a meeting with prison administrators. That initiative came in the midst of several attacks on prison officers by persons said to be acting on the orders of incarcerated gang leaders who were calling shots on officers from behind bars. What action has since flowed from that announcement is unclear but whatever steps were taken, if any, they were clearly not enough to prevent last weeks jail-break.Like the countrys water infrastructure, the state of T&Ts prisons constitutes an emergency. The fact that eight men could have been put into one cell speaks volumes of the archaic infrastructure.It is time to face the reality of the urgent need for a significant investment in prison upgrade and transformation.Continuing to paper over cracks will only create gaping holes through which accused murderers can wiggle their way out to freedom, eight men at a time.^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 18:59:59^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/ea/bea3c592-1d98-11e8-b6c0-9f28fff415be/5a9872b1847d7.image.jpg?resize=400%2C307^"Prison emergency

51^COMMENTING on Mondays budget review, an Express editorial said what Finance Minister Colm Imbert sees as stability is really paralysis, a view shared by former finance minister Selby Wilson who saw nothing much in the presentation.Indeed, Imberts recovery is nothing more than increased gas production already threatened by recent developments. So there is no foundation for the future, as he claims. But this is Absurdistan, where this minister could be leading a nation to economic ruin, claim he is doing a fantastic job and people are expected to walk docilely to their demise. Anyone who points out failings is branded as unpatriotic, a naysayer, and an Opposition member says former finance minister Mariano Browne.From day one, I warned this administration that economic restructuring is one of three issues needing immediate and urgent attention. A global energy revolution was moving apace, permanently weakening energy prices and reducing national revenue which dropped from $57.26 billion in 2015 to $42.62 billion in 2018. I had to repeatedly chastise Imbert and his prime minister for continuing to bank on our energy industry, like people demented by a terrible loss, unable to accept the new reality.They ended up wasting four precious years, placing the economy in unprecedented precariousness. We have a long way to go for a turnaround says UWI economist Vaalmikki Arjoon. On Monday, Imbert promised transformation. Previously, he had promised a new paradigm. But it has been unrelenting staleness. For, there can be no transformation without diversification. Economist Dr Ronald Ramkissoon agrees, wanting investments in the non-energy sectors. Even the country chair of Shell, Derek Hudson, says this country needs to diversify quite rapidly. But diversification makes our prime minister annoyed, confirming our state of Absurdistan.Diversification must generate new foreign earnings. The energy sector can no longer provide 80 per cent of our foreign currency. Our reserves have therefore been dwindling from US$14 billion in August 2015 to US$7.8 billion at December 2018. Because of the inaccessibility of foreign exchange, the manufacturing sector is underutilised by over 30 per cent says Arjoon.And with the 29 per cent increase in national debt to almost $100 billion, even more foreign exchange will be consumed by debt servicing which has doubled from $5.64 billion, 9.8 per cent of revenue in 2015 to $8.76 billion or 20.5 per cent in 2018. This country is now running a primary fiscal deficit which means we are borrowing to pay interest on existing debt! We are in the jaws of the debt trap! And with elections coming, they are borrowing more, pushing the nation into deeper darkness. Yet Imbert claims we are on the upswing to glory. And we are expected to dance to his distortions! Welcome to Absurdistan.And the continuing oil and gas glut will further depress national revenue. Through shale, the US will produce 13.2 million bpd by the end of 2020, becoming the worlds largest oil producer. It is now the third largest LNG exporter, 500 shipments to 28 countries in 2018, soon to permeate the Caribbean through Jamaica as a transhipment hub. And more plants are coming. ExxonMobil, Chevron and now Occidental aim for spectacular growth in the Permian Basin. And with Big Oil involved, the shale revolution is being exported to Canada, Latin America, China, Africa and the Middle East. Shale is upending the global oil and gas industry, says Trisha Curtis of Consultancy, PetroNerds.And still more oil and gas are coming. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now boosting margins, particularly in the very expensive upstream operations. Faster and more efficient in assessing massive information, AI is helping to uncover resources, says British Petroleum (BP). French company Total has partnered with Google Cloud to develop AI for assessing oil and gas-fields to enhance exploration, extracting oil and gas with less capital investment.Small wonder global drilling will surge in 2019 as companies and countries pursue maximum extraction before peak oil sets in. There will be 46,209 wells all over the globe this year and 2,204 wells offshore. Deep-water production will jump to a record-high of 10.3 million. More oil and gas, less expensive to produce, means even cheaper prices and continuing loss of earnings for Trinidad and Tobago. Hear that Colm Imbert, disregarder of diversification?And in the midst of this massive global production comes the shock that BP natural gas production in this country will fall by 15 per cent amounting to 300 million standard cubic feet per day in 2020 and 2021, affecting not only LNG production but petrochemicals, natural gas liquids, condensate and crude oil, bringing unemployment and loss of hundreds of millions to the treasury, as the Guardians Curtis Williams, points out. Train One could be shut down. The effect would be colossal and Imberts attempt to trivialise the loss is a disservice to the nation says Williams who justifiably accuses the minister of playing smart with foolishness and trying to deceive the nation.This is our precariousness after four budgets and four mid-year reviews by this finance minister. And I havent even mentioned renewable energy growing phenomenally and further threatening oil and gas revenue. In another country, as I recommended two years ago, Imbert would have been removed from office on one issue only: his failure to seed new foreign earnings at a time when we either diversify or die as an economy and society. But this is Absurdistan, so Colm carries on.^Ralph Maraj^"

52^MY colleague Anthony Smart has asked for particulars of my assertion of bungling on the part of the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) Government following the attempted coup in 1990. He reminds us that he was attorney general of the NAR government during that period until the NAR lost office in November 1991.Thats easy, Anthony.After the hostages were released, the dominant elements in the NAR government decided that they would represent to the world that the Muslimeen had surrendered unconditionally. The government would also try to avoid acknowledging the grant of the amnesty and to postpone having its validity determined by the courts for as long as possible.I was told to my face, at the time, by one member of the dominant elements, that a reason for the strategy was that they did not want the amnesty subsequently to become an election issue. The strategy backfired, precipitated by the lawyers for the Muslimeen promptly launching habeas corpus proceedings challenging their detention.The rest, as they say is history.The attempted coup makers were not tried in the criminal courts. As a result, the country received a message that if you allegedly do something wrong nothing will come of it. That message, according to some commentators, was a catalyst for a general decline in law and order.I use the expression the dominant elements in the government because the NAR government did not always appear to be acting collectively or including all of its members in its decision-making concerning the attempted coup. Then-prime minister Robinson had been shot, key figures were kept away from interaction with the lawyers voluntarily assisting, and certain other dysfunctional things happened from time to time.I am not reliant on hearsay or folklore for my assertions. The NAR government had an unprecedented legal situation on its hands.I was one of several Senior Counsel and other lawyers who responded to calls to serve the country and give advice. I was present at meetings in Camp Ogden and the Hilton hotel and went to Robinsons residence twice.Despite the excellent job done by the belated Simmons Commission of Enquiry, the country will only have the complete story of 1990 if those active in its unravelling tell what they know first-hand, as Raoul Pantin did about the hostage situation inside Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT).It must be emphasised that the Simmons Commission remained perplexed at the fact that an important legal point about the amnesty was not taken. That is on the commissions record of proceedings.When I gave evidence to the commission and produced documents, I was asked why the point was not pursued. My answer was: Politics.I was not asked to elaborate. Had I been, I would have given chapter and verse on the bungling particularised above, as there is so much to tell.I had intended to write a book about the grant of the amnesty and the political manoeuvres around it, carried out against the advice of many of the lawyers. I did not because of pressures on my time and more recently there was another impediment.I learned when I produced The Daly Commentaries that there is a dearth of publishers or others able or willing to fund such a work, which requires the hiring of a highly competent editor and the essential work of referencing with footnotes.As to marketing a book without an agent, let me relate an experience I had with the National Library and Information System Authority (Nalis). Nalis has a commendable first time authors programme but I had a sobering experience with its Education Division to which I paid a visit at their Chaguanas office.The division took two copies of the book to have it reviewed for placement in school libraries. The book passed review, but I was finally told earlier this year that the Education Division had no money for purchase of resources for the schools.Nalis stated that every year since 2016 monies have not been released.So much, therefore, at least for now, about what the public should know and how frustrating it can be to try to leave an historical record.^Martin Daly^"

53^AT the breaking heart of downtown Port of Spain, inside the landmark Colin Laird structure that is the National Library, expect no complimentary drinking water.That message went out in a notice from the executive director, advising all that NALIS can no longer spend $6,522 a month to meet demand for purified water.This long-time frequenter of the Knox Street Public Library, and later of government offices, recalls when only plain pipe water was available to quench thirst. Or, for the privileged, ice water from an office mini-tank, before arrival of the plugged-in cooler operated by stepping on a floor-level pedal.NALIS went further. The notice directed a start to the practice of keeping self-supplied toilet paper in handbags, briefcases or desk drawers. No longer can NALIS provide that free good. The water and toilet paper cutbacks are to take effect from June 3. The official notice prayed for understanding of the grim financial realities that made necessary the cessation of benefits long taken for granted.We strive for survival, the executive director wrote, citing realities of this guava season. The NALIS executive director also referred to this rough patch and these trying times. Just then, in the Parliament, some blocks south on the Port of Spain waterfront, Finance Minister Colm Imbert was telling an economic success story.TV showed water in plastic bottles on the desks of MPs. But in the broadcast images, no other evidence was visible or imaginable of a T&T state with its people scrimping to survive. Yes, there had been a downturn, the Imbert story went. But a turnaround had eventually taken effect, since 2018 when three consecutive quarters of economic growth had been experienced. In a continuing trend, the today picture confirms a clear indication of an economic recovery.Mr Imbert had been a ranking officer in the PNM array which, in 2015, presented arms as being red and ready to contend against economic decline caused by some 40 per cent reduction in energy income. In an unspoken understanding, he would figure as the second in command, in Keith Rowleys absence, unfailingly acting as Prime Minister. As Finance Minister, missioned annually to deliver one and a half budgets, he emerged as both a specialist authority and a hands-on action figure in a commanding role over T&T economy matters. More than that, Mr Imbert has been the in-house compiler of the Rowley administration record, a built-in organisational capacity to chronicle its life and times.In his mid-year budget review, last week, he harked back to times in the field, before the 2015 electoral victory. He recounted the PNM hopefuls work on preparing for government. Last week, he assumed ownership of a vision conceptualised while out of office, resolutely and consistently implemented while in office. Here was the lyrics man applying a positive spin on all now being conducted in the name of government. He labelled it a carefully sequenced programme of macroeconomic adjustment and reform, otherwise branded as a disciplined fiscal strategy embedded in our economic transformation agenda. Translated into real-world effects, he last week described what, by 2018, had defined itself as a disciplined fiscal stance intended to bring expenditure broadly in line with revenue potential. Incoming revenue first; legitimate and deferrable demands later. The Rowley-Imbert team, applying the squeeze on spending, closed ears to any resulting cries of pain.Spending deemed unproductive was cut. The administration claimed to be pursuing the game-changing goal of continual improvement in the efficiency of operations of government and the public sector more generally. In this ambitious latter pursuit, results over nearly four years are hard to identify. Which government operations have become more noticeably efficient? Nearly none can believably make that claim.What resulted could be summarised as the posture of a bad-pay government, that would defer or reject demands of organisations and people left holding tokens expressive of what they have, as of right, expected to collect. Ask contractors, VAT-refund hopefuls, local government bodies indebted to water truck companies, security helicopter units with no air-worthy machines to hunt murderous prison escapees...Put it all down to Rowley-Imbert economic policy priorities. Both have played down or have been dismissive of diversifying away from energy. Gas and oil define prospects of the here and now; anything else marks wishful thinking. Economic diversification makes hardly any appearance in Imberts latest outpouring.We are ensuring that natural gas production will continue to be a major driver of economic growth, he affirmed. BPTT may have hit no infill undersea pay dirt. But theres always BHP Billiton, said the Minister, breathing relief. BHP Billiton discovered a significant gas find in 2018, and another last month. Its digging deeper for hydrocarbons in the Gulf of Mexico, and in also in T&T waters, where its here to stay, but nowhere else in the world. It is indisputable fact that we have recovered from the oil shock of 2014 to 2016, and we have stabilised our economy, Imbert claimed.People hurting for drinking water and toilet paper can wait.^Lennox Grant^"

54^In a recent survey on one of our local television stations, the people meter question was, Should teachers be suspended as soon as accusations of sexual misconduct are raised?. The survey showed that 91 per cent said yes while nine per cent said no.Now, if one allows ones emotions to take over, then one is inclined to vote yes immediately. Considering teachers are people who should be trusted with the safety and welfare of our children, any hint of misconduct on the teachers part would cause any parent to fly into a rage.^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 19:00:08^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"Making the case foraccused teachers

55^THE title is borrowed (without permission) from the person whose comment on social media went viral.After hearing about yet another incident which might leave the average citizen staggering in shock, he wondered quite aptly which Season and Episode of Trinidad and Tobago we were at. Take win man.Eight hard back men on capital charges were able to dig a hole and escape from their prison cells. The next thing we will hear about may be an El Chapo-esque tunnel. While we are told that the ratio of prison officers to prisoners meets international standards, the Commissioner of Prisons and all his predecessors have said exactly the opposite. We should just be thankful that no prison officer met the escapees on their way out because that may have been another kind of grief.The Ministry of National Security gets the largest chunk of the budget. They receive more than Education and Health. We now know that no money was being spent to fix the helicopters which were to be used as crime-fighting tools so I suppose the monies allocated to the Air Guard went to renting helicopters unsuitable for the purpose and paying salaries. In the driest season we have had for a long time we do not even have helicopters to help the fire services put out bush fires.But if Air Guard costs were lower, where did that excess go? Why are prison officers still too few? Is it that there is to be re-structuring which will result in short term contractual appointments being used instead? Or, God forbid, the system will be privatised? This is a field of work which requires specialised training for prison officers to function optimally. They are not simply security guards and they work in an extremely high risk environment.Now we hear that a new prison fence must be built. Is it that no one recognised the inadequacy of the existing one until the break out? With all that money allocated, and with legislation which allows for persons convicted of serious crimes to be imprisoned for lengthy periods, we need a massive break-out to think about a fence?What about cameras? Many citizens have had no choice but to put up security cameras in their own homes because of the high crime situation. Was the Prison Service not furnished with surveillance cameras on the perimeters of the compound at Golden Grove?I dont know if the post which seems to have been put up on social media by one of the escapees was posted by him or someone on his behalf. What it makes clear is that the period on remand for prisoners continues to be ridiculously long. It also allowed that person to put a spin on the evidence of his case before he is tried so that any member of the public sitting on a jury will have access to that information.Further, if the newspaper report which I read was correct, nothing was done to provide the witness in question with extra security, at least until the fugitives are back in custody. And we expect citizens to come forward as witnesses when this entire day will be chronicled as debacle after debacle?Quite frankly, it seems that the duties given to the Honourable Minister of National Security has spread him too thin. These numerous hats are capable of turning him into a jack of all trades and master of none when his talents should be focused on his areas of expertise. We do the minister a disservice by pretending he is omnipotent and the country is done a disservice as a result.I agree that the minister is doing his best. His reputation before he entered politics was such that he will do his best at whatever task he is assigned. But the National Security Ministry is a highly specialised environment which is impossible to understand in depth if you are responsible for so many other things. As is for example, the oil and gas industry.To add absurdity to insecurity, the person driving backwards around the Savannah took the corner in reverse, better than I can while driving forward. That wasnt the absurdity to which I refer. It was the fact that a journalist thought that it was newsworthy to write a report pointing out that the TTPS said that this was illegal. The TTPS is quite right but is it not common sense that reversing along a one-way roadway will be against the law? Is that news?Every week it seems we celebrate a Day for this and a Day for that. Recently we celebrated one for the media. In a country where the media is relatively free, I wonder why so much of this freedom is squandered on reports like the one above and not on high quality investigative journalism. There are journalists who do that even under repressive regimes and who are prepared to sacrifice their liberty and sometimes their lives to ensure that they honour the profession they have entered and that they do it credit.These days some of the investigative articles sound simply like re-worded press releases.Sophia K Chote SC is an Independent Senator^Sophia K Chote SC^"

56^I bear a grudge that we in Trinidad do not pay enough attention to our heroes. They are the people that will give Trinidad life. Beryl McBurnie quoted in Judy Raymonds Beryl McBurnie.THERE has been much coverage about the horrible murder of the Prime Ministers boyhood friend John Mills and his wife Eulyn at the hands of a monstrously deranged person.This dastardly act led the PM to bemoan: What have we become? What are we producing as the next generation? John and I grew up together in poverty, with pride, but violence and criminality were never part of our life (Express, May 4).While I hear the PMs revulsion about what violence does to people, we never consider how it also damages our environment and tears up our communities. Hence the question: How/why, in the name of progress, do we create conditions where cultural and environmental violence are allowed to stalk the land without understanding how it disfigures our people?Apart from occasional forays abroad, I have lived in Tacarigua all of my life. In 1984, I wrote Tacarigua, A Village in Trinidad.In 1985, I brought a television crew from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, that produced a documentary on my village.While we were filming, a county council crew was busy cutting down the second-to-last samaan tree that graced the Holy Ground Savannah. I included that violent act in my documentary.Some years prior to doing my documentary the villagers (we call ourselves districkers) put on a strenuous fight to prevent Kirpalani and Hi-Lo from building a supermarket on the Holy Ground Savannah. In other words, we saved that portion of our savannah through the activism of Tacarigua districkers.In 2013, under the leadership of Carol James and Ulric Buggy Haynes, we waged a major campaign that saved the Orange Grove Savannah, now called the Eddie Hart Savannah, from Anil Roberts and the UNC who proposed to build a sports centre, a swimming pool, a car park for 350 vehicles, and a concrete road on those savannah greens.Our actions also saved the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. In Preserving the Tacarigua Savannah: Respecting Our Heritage, I wrote: The area of which we speak is the natural water table for the residents of the area. It is the most significant aquifer in northeast Trinidad, providing the water supply for a significant part of north, east and central Trinidad. There are twelve WASA pumps around the savannah that provide drinking water for the hundreds of thousands of people in north east Trinidad.When we hear that our southern compatriots are experiencing a shortage of water, we can better understand how the heroic efforts of the people of Tacarigua and surrounding areas preserved the lives of so many of our fellow citizens. Had we not made such a valiant effort then, the people of the northeast may have been facing similar water challenges today.Today, we are faced with a struggle of a different but related kind: that is, the possible destruction of one of Tacariguas most historic buildings without any thought being given to the harm (or perhaps dismemberment) that such a demolition may mean to the harmony and well-being of district life.I refer to the house of the late Joshua Stanley at the corner of Beckles Street and Eastern Main Road, Tacarigua, a splendid Victorian building that has stood guard over the Holy Ground Savannah from the early 20th century. We learn it has been sold and may be demolished. That must not happen.Many historic buildings in Tacarigua have been demolished over the years. The Tacarigua EC School (built in 1837), the major buildings of the St Marys Childrens Home (established in 1857) and the Murray mansion that was built at the end of the 19th century have been demolished. Only St Marys Rectory (built in 1842) still stands.Sometimes we act as though only human life matters. But there is life in nature, in the trees, the stones and the buildings we inhabit. I learned this truth from Wilson Harris who spent years in the Guyana jungle as a surveyor and who made me aware of the close communion between people and nature.Martin Heidegger conveyed this sentiment when he wrote: To dwell, to be set at peace, means to remain at peace with the free, the preserve, the free sphere that safeguards each thing in its nature. The fundamental character of dwelling is the sparing and preserving. It pervades dwelling in its whole range. That range reveals itself to us as soon as we reflect that human beings consist in dwelling and, indeed, dwelling in the sense of the stay of mortals on the earth.Buildings are part of our human community. They breathe life into the community and give meaning to what we do. This is why we must do everything to ensure the iconic Stanley house in Tacarigua be saved from destruction. It should be converted into a community museum. It should not suffer the fate of CLR Jamess house in Tunapuna, George Padmore and Sylvester Williams dwelling in Arouca, and Beryl McBurnies Folk House in Woodbrook.Violence is not only what we do against sentient beings. It is also reflected in how we treat non-sentient beings and other forms of life around us. The violence that we do to those forms of life will come back to haunt us. This might explain the restlessness and dysfunctionality that pervade our nation today.Next week I will talk about Joshua Stanleys life.Prof Cudjoes e-mail address isscudjoe@wellesley.edu.

59^A PREGNANT woman yesterday appeared before the court charged with twice exposing a three-year-old boy to suffering.This after a man allegedly burnt the childs hands and hit him in his eye and mouth.Crystal Marchan, 35, of Princes Town said she was not guilty of the both offences against her.The mother of two appeared before San Fernando Second Court Magistrate Nikolas Ali charged with being a person responsible for the child, exposed him in a manner likely to cause him suffering to his physical health on March 30 this year and December 18, 2018, at Marabella,The charge was laid under the Childrens Act by WPC Nicole St John of the Child Protection Unit.Magistrate Ali said, from the information, the child was hit in the face and his hands burnt.Ali asked Marchan whether she understood the charge and before entering her not guilty plea, she said: I was in fear of my life and didnt call the police in time to get help for him.Police prosecutor Sgt Gangoo said the Childrens Authority had been contacted and the child had been staying with a relative.Marchan who was unrepresented said she had no matters before the court.Police prosecutor Sgt Gangoo said a name check did not reveal any matters against her.He however asked that conditions be imposed should bail be granted.Marchan had one relative in court, her stepfather, who said Marchan had been staying by him.Ali placed him as her surety as he granted Marchan $20,000 bail with the condition that she reports to the Princes Town Police Station once a week.The matter was adjourned to June 14 when Marchan will appear before the First Court.In a related case, it was last month that Marcus John faced the court charged with burning the hands of the boy and hitting him in his face.It was alleged against him that in March 2019 and December 2018, he assaulted the child in a manner likely to cause him physical and emotional suffering.John, 33, of Marabella, was placed on bail but has been unable to access it.He remains in custody and will reappear in court on May 22.The three-year-old boys hands were burnt after they were allegedly held over the open flame of a stove.Months later, the boy was allegedly struck in the eye and also hit with a ruler on his mouth when he was unable to write a letter of the alphabet.^Nikita Braxton-Benjamin^"

60^A STATE witness charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, yesterday told the court that his life could be at risk should he be sent to prison.Clint Beharry said the man accused of the double murder he witnessed was in custody.Beharry, 43, was before San Fernando magistrate Nikolas Ali charged that on May 16 at Born Free Bar in Pleasantville, he had 23 packets of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The drug weighed 13.46 kilogrammes and a release from the police service said the street value was $134,000.In his bid for bail for Beharry, defence attorney Shaun Teekasingh said he was a State witness in a double homicide. He said the accused in that matter was at the Maximum Security Prison in Arouca.Teekasingh also told the court that his client had no previous convictions over the past ten years and had no pending matters. Beharry, he said, was willing to comply with any bail conditions.Police prosecutor Sgt Gangoo made no objection to Beharrys bail. Ali placed him on $75,000 bail with a cash alternative of $30,000 and with the condition that he reports to the Mon Repos police station other times a week.Teekasingh said, given the time of Beharrys court appearance after 3 p.m. it may be difficult for his family to access the bail. He asked that it be endorsed on the record that officers transporting Beharry be careful with him and that if he was sent to the general population, he may be a risk.One witness has already been killed in the matter, Teekasingh told the court.Ali made note of Teekasinghs information and police prosecutor Sgt Gangoo said the officers escorting prisoners could inform prison officials.Teekasingh said, I will also contact the prison facility, in the event that he doesnt access bail, of the possible threat.The matter was adjourned to June 14.The Express was told that Beharrys bail was not posted and he was taken to prison on Friday evening.^Nikita Braxton-Benjamin^"

65^IF ANYONE doubted the huge job Manchester United manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer has on his hands, then the final home loss to relegated Cardiff is testament to that. Finishing badly in sixth place and 32 points behind rivals Manchester City, it demonstrates what a huge gap there is between the two teams.United fans have been tested to the limits, from the David Moyes mistake through to depressing, moaning, irritable Jose Mourinho. Probably the only sensible decision Uniteds board have taken over the past few years was to make Solskjaer the interim manager whilst searching for a permanent replacement. Then, like a gambler who has a win and then goes betting mad, they appointed the Norwegian permanently and since then, it has all gone the way of Mourinho.United have to get their transfer policy in order, they have to bring in the right players, not just big names.

70^DESPITE several instances of sexual harassment of pupils by teachers being reported and investigated in the past few years, very few have resulted in convictions or disciplinary action against the teachers.And in some cases, the alleged perpetrator is allowed to return to the school to continue teaching.This was revealed by chairman of the Teaching Service Commission (TSC) Dr Fazal Ali yesterday as he spoke during a Joint Select Committee enquiry into sexual harassment in the education sector.INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS: Dr Fazal Ali, chairman of the Teaching Service Commission, responds to a question posed by the chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights, Equality and Diversity yesterday.Ali said, between 2014 and 2019, the Commission received 33 reports of sexual misconduct and harassment in primary and secondary schools. The majority (21 cases) were perpetrated by male teachers against female pupils.There were also four cases of male teachers sexually harassing male pupils, two cases of female teachers sexually harassing male pupils and instances of teachers sexually harassing other teachers.Giving examples, Ali said there were cases of primary school teachers touching, squeezing and commenting on the size of the private parts of male pupils and another case where a teacher offered to do certain things with a primary school pupil.Ali said there was a case of a male teacher inappropriately touching a female pupil and taking off her shirt as well as another case where a maxi-taxi driver sexually harassed a child in a maxi and the mother was advised by the principal not to report the matter.Further, there have been cases of teachers sending inappropriate text messages to pupils detailing what they wanted to do and even going as far as sending photographs of their private areas to pupils.Teachers are texting asking children if their parents are home, how often they are home, where they live. They are texting images of human body parts and asking them to respond to it, he said.Unwilling victimsPresident of the National Parent Teacher Association (NPTA) Raffiena Ali-Boodoosingh noted that there are also acts of sexual misconduct between pupils. She said although the NPTA has no hardcore data, the organisation has received anecdotal reports by pupils and parents who have witnessed sexual acts between pupils, including homosexual acts between male pupils in school bathrooms and other areas of the schools.But while these cases have been reported to the Ministry of Education and the TSC, there has been only a two per cent success rate in achieving a resolution.TSC member Joanne Joseph-Hannays said when such reports are received, there is usually a recommendation for suspension of the teacher while an investigation is ongoing. The teacher may then go before a tribunal to determine if there is sufficient evidence for action to be taken. But she said many of the cases fail due to parents unwillingness to have the child give evidence at the tribunal and the failure of both parents and school officials to report the matter to the police.In the few cases that have been resolved, Ali said it was because parents pursued the issue as a criminal matter with the police and not through the Ministry or the Commission.None of the 33 cases was resolved via the tribunal method.The children are not willing to give evidence in a tribunal setting. The parents are not willing to let them relive that experience, said Ali.Questioned by Committee chairman Dr Nyan Gadsby-Dolly what happens to the teachers who were accused of sexual misconduct against pupils if no evidence is forthcoming at the tribunal, Joseph-Hannays said no disciplinary action can be taken.Once it fails at the tribunal level, we have no choice but to reinstate the teacher at the school, she said.Prevention protocolsAli said in one case, a teacher was found guilty of an offence committed in 2014 by the Magistrates Court and was fined $8,000. But despite being found guilty, the Commission could not dismiss the teacher unless it receives a copy of the court transcript which it is still yet to receive.Joseph-Hannays said there must be more efficiency in dealing with these matters. She said teachers should be charged under the Child Act as the penalties under this act are more severe.Under the Child Act, the penalties would range from 15-25 years imprisonment and life imprisonment if there is sexual contact.But while the TSC only recorded 33 complaints of sexual misconduct and harassment in schools between 2014-2019, Gadsby-Dolly noted that the problem could be more widespread and many instances are not reported.Ali said the Commission and the ministry must work together to do an assessment of each school and how they record instances of sexual harassment, establish protocols for prevention and for police to also keep records.He said a method must also be established for the protection of children so they can feel safe and their parents can feel comfortable to have them give evidence at a tribunal.^Camille Hunte^"

72^The One Caribbean Media group (OCM) which includes the Express newspaper today pays respect to Barbados-born Caribbean visionary Harold Hoyte, whose recent passing we mourn.Mr Hoyte was founding editor of the Nation (part of the OCM group), the dominant newspaper in Barbados for much of its existence over the last 46 years. He was one of the leading lights in the formation of OCM. In paying her own tribute to him, OCM CEO Dawn Thomas described Mr Hoyte as a great champion, both of press freedom and of Caribbean unity. Personally, she said, she was grateful for the wealth of wisdom she gained from him over the years, and for the many words of wisdom during challenging times. He will be sincerely missed, but his remarkable legacy will live on.Mr Hoyte started his career in media as a copywriter with the Barbados Advocate in 1959. He would later move to Toronto, Canada, where he worked with the Globe and Mail newspaper and the Toronto Telegram, before becoming editor of the Contrast, Torontos first black newspaper. He would return to Barbados in 1973, and pursued a dream and a vision, defying considerable odds in the process. With a group of courageous friends and associates, he launched the Nation newspaper, and would spend the next 30 years as its editor, and then editor-in-chief. After his retirement he remained as editor emeritus, providing valuable guidance and direction to those at the helm.Describing him as a regional media champion, OCM noted in its public tribute to Mr Hoyte that he was moved by the limited success of the regional integration movement (Caricom) as well as earlier efforts. To this end, he dedicated his energies towards making this a reality in his chosen fields of journalism and business.For the stellar contributions he made on these fronts over the succeeding decades, he was to garner a long list of rewards and honours. These included such citations as Honorary Fellow, University of the West Indies, Honorary Doctor of Letters, University of the West Indies, Director of the Eastern Caribbean Press Council, Member of the Commonwealth Press Union and of the Inter-American Press Association.In 2003 he was awarded the Gold Crown of Merit by the Barbados government. Further afield, he was awarded the Maria Cabot Moors Award for press freedom by Columbia University. He was appointed to the board of the Barbados Central Bank and was also Deputy Chairman of the Barbados Law and Order Commission, and Chairman of the Substance Abuse Foundation.Above all, however, Harold Hoyte was among the most visionary leaders and innovators in Caribbean journalism for the decades during which he influenced generations across our region. His commitment to fairness, integrity and fearlessness in pursuit of the truth has become legendary to those who knew and worked with him.With some of those values captured in the several books he authored, his example remains a deep inspiration for generations to come.^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 19:00:59^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/fd/8fd7855a-1d98-11e8-b6f4-d7dd3075b777/5a9872931da98.image.jpg?resize=400%2C307^"Celebrating Harold Hoyte

75^In just under a weeks time voters from across the whole of the European Union (EU) will go to the polls to elect a new European Parliament.The result is expected to alter Europes centrist balance, and more importantly contribute to the repositioning of all political parties including those in France, Germany, and an already semi-detached Britain.For nearly a decade, Brexit notwithstanding, far right and populist political groups have been gaining support. Where once, one could reliably predict that citizens in most EU nations would largely vote on economic and national issues, electorates have become less predictable.Angry with establishment politics and elites, marginalised by de-industrialisation and austerity, large groups of citizens and whole regions have turned to parties that have channelled their frustration by weaponising negative sentiment about migration and the defence of national culture and identity.The effect has been the rise across Europe of new or reconstructed political groupings including Frances Rassemblement National led by Marine le Pen, Germanys Alterativ fr Deutschland, Vox in Spain, the Brexit Party in the UK, and Liga in Italy. It has also seen illiberal governments emerge in Hungary, Poland and elsewhere, and the rise of vociferous factions openly expressing views that are xenophobic, racist, anti-Islam or anti-Semitic.Most pollsters suggest that in this European election it will be the populist and nationalist parties that make significant gains.Analysis by multi-media platform Politico suggests an outcome involving a significant shift to the right. Politico suggests that within the next 751-seat European Parliament, 388 of its members will represent centrist parties, 212 right wing parties, 123 will be left of centre and 28 will come from other parties. It additionally believes that of those likely to be elected, 465 will be pro-EU, a sizeable minority of 257 will be Eurosceptic, and 29 will have an unclear position.How accurate such forecasts may be, could additionally depend on the hard-to-gauge influence of externally financed or directed third parties.Using social media and pan-European data bases to discredit facts and rational argument, such groups appear to be seeking the election of radical right-wing parties able to return greater control to individual European states, thereby weakening European coherence.The expectation therefore is that the May 23-to-26 vote will result in a European Parliament that is less consensus- driven, more fragmented, and have a smaller pro-European majority.More will become clear after the new Parliament convenes on July 2. Then, those elected by national ballot will have formed themselves into EU-wide parliamentary political groupings, of which there are presently eight.Later as the parliamentary term proceeds, these pan-European political coalitions will influence Europes international relations, having the final say, for example, on development policy and the development budget, foreign and security policy, trade agreements, and whatever post 2020 treaty arrangements are negotiated with the ACP and its regions.Caricom states have always felt confident for historic reasons of their ability to exert political influence in Europe in these and other respects. However, the EU is on the cusp of change, not just as a consequence of Brexit, but because the balance of political power in each of its institutions is in flux.The centre right in the European Parliament is weakening and may divide, Germanys Chancellor, Angela Merkel is to step down in 2021, Frances president Macron is seeking profound change and deeper European political integration, while Italy and some eastern states are interested in fundamental reform and a less federal Europe.This suggests that the Caribbean countries will need to think strategically about future relations and to cultivate new high-level political interlocutors who have an interest in the region.As Europes High Representative, Federica Mogherini, recently wrote in the Caribbean media, the EU remains a major investor, trade partner, a provider of development assistance and humanitarian relief, believes in dialogue and the peaceful resolution of crises, supports the need to address climate change, and shares the regions values.Unfortunately, in recent years and despite the efforts of ambassadors, most Caribbean governments have paid little high-level attention to developing a more strategic relationship with political groups in the Parliament, the Council or the higher reaches of the European Commission, preferring to still see the EU as an aid donor.It is an impression reinforced by the May 13/14 meeting of Caribbean foreign ministers in Grenada.Despite the recent publication of a European policy paper setting out the breadth of the EUs vision for its future relations with the Caribbean and Latin America, there was no acknowledgement of its significance or even its existence in the final communique.Instead the most prominent references were to the need for Caricom to strategically consider its long-term engagement with the US, Venezuela, the post Brexit trade arrangement with the UK, Cuba, and concern about the EUs blacklisting of some regional financial jurisdictions.It is possible that foreign ministers may have considered the issue in caucus when they discussed a presentation on Leveraging the Communitys Voice in an Era of Challenge and Disorder, but this is far from clear.That said, officials in Brussels continue to stress the EUs genuine desire to broaden its political dialogue with the Caribbean, observing that a mutually arrived at strategic understanding would add long-term value by offering an approach that is different to that of China and the US.Common sense suggests that in a rapidly changing world this is the moment when the region should look over the horizon and recognise that a close political relationship with like-minded groups in Europes new parliament and its sovereign states will in future be as strategically important as its transatlantic relations with the United Kingdom, a country which post Brexit may take a decade or more to stabilise and reinvent itself.^David Jessop^"

76^My friend from Mumbai was startled when he first visited Chaguanas more than a decade ago. Afterwards, he had written about discovering something akin to an Indian village from the past, a place frozen in time, still gazing at the world through eyes misty with tradition.His India had moved on, but here, in this remote part of the world, he found customs and rituals splayed out on daily routines with a fidelity that was only diluted by the way things can get lost in translation. The people he met were performing rites in a language they barely knewthe meanings of words were hazy, pronunciations were distorted, the purpose of the activities was sometimes misunderstood, but the spirit was vibrant. And therein lay the reason for its perpetuation. It was a bond with their ancestral identity.On a recent trip to the National Cocoa and Chocolate Museum of Trinidad and Tobago (owned by Eric Lewis, the self-proclaimed Prince of Moruga, who is worthy of a separate study), we passed through Warren Road and Bejucal Road in Chaguanas and historian Prof Brinsley Samaroo (a national treasure), related the antecedents of this enclave. It was a completely insular community, the descendants of Indian indentured workers enclosing themselves in a cocoon that to this day refuses to allow outsiders in. Should they choose to breach those walls, the younger generation of its inhabitants have to leave.How has this managed to survive in a country that has accumulated the largest groups of immigrants in the region? It is one of the many anomalies that define this complicated space that still boasts of its cosmopolitan nature. The world today continues to heave with the turbulence thrown up by these pockets of resistance.And you ask yourself, why?In a sense it must be linked to an anxiety, a fear of losing the identity that is all you have left when you have been transplanted. So much of it was taken away at the point of departure from the motherland; suddenly you were no longer the bearer of your family name, but a faceless body destined for a land that was remaking you at every drop of the colonial hat.Many years ago, I tried to find out where my maternal grandfather had come from, but there was so little to go on, and the name that was on his identification card was clearly not the name he had when he left India. It was the name some British official had probably carelessly designated for him and thus, when he left Indian shores, it was as if the sea had opened up and swallowed him. Nothing existed of his Indian life for his descendants here to trace. Nothing existed of his life in Trinidad for his Indian family to follow.It may seem I am writing about an Indian experience, but we know this is the colonial story, this is the story of slavery, this is a shared history in every part of the world where colonists cast bloodied nets to pillage economic resources and to spread their empire.There is much that fuels the racial passions in this country of many dialects and languages. To me, politics stands as the biggest culprit. It is why I hardly engage in any writing on what passes for it. It is not just because it is so puerile, but I feel the corruption that pervades its practices has contaminated the country fatally.But Ive been thinking of why people hang on to the ritualswhich I am not linking with racism herebecause I am simply trying to understand the nature of these bonds.The other day I was listening to some old Bollywood songs, and watching the scenes in which they were performed. Say what you want, nothing rivals those movies for lavish sets, brilliant colour, or the magnificent landscapes. The music and the dance I was watching were imbued with a sense of grandeur, of joyfulness and a kind of timelessness. Here were people going through all the miseries and hardships that only Bollywood could lay on so relentlesslyand they could whirl it away amidst soundtracks from the amazing Lata Mangeshkar and singers like Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam.I remember as a child, the overwhelming excitement of the adults around me when the Sunday midday movie came on. Everyone would scramble upstairs to my grandfathers house to sprawl all over his large living room to watch them on his black and white television set.Needless to say, there were many moments of tears during the sessions, but no one moved. I was recalling that, recalling how for so many, the songs of India became the way to feel a sense of kinship, of belonging to something old and grand, and timeless. Most people know and connect to these songs from their childhood. It is a recollection of family. The further back you go, the more you feel a link to that motherland.You dont have to understand the meaning of the words to experience that emotional tug. It is as powerful as any mantra. It is a reminder of the place where you came from, but it is also something that takes you back to your childhood days, when as rough as it might be, love was in the air. And you felt safe inside your cocoon.vaneisabaksh@gmail.com^Vaneisa Baksh^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:10^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/75/175640a6-6952-11e9-8b00-8b351dfd73cd/5cc4fd0da88bf.image.jpg?resize=400%2C532^"A songa dancea passage back home

77^The Minister of Finance, in his mid-term budget review, again declared that the economy has turned around and produced figures that showed that there was GDP growth over three consecutive quarters, which to economists indicates that the economy is on a growth path.Our economic performance is driven by our oil/gas production, the prices fetched in the market either as basic commodities (crude oil or LNG) or as downstream petrochemicals. Production of oil and gas depends on the encouragement of foreign direct investment that exploits the petroleum resource.In such a production system there are long term trends (climate change included) that are governed by exploration and production rates, depletion of the resource and the increasing costs to produce the petroleum. The short term trends are driven by exogenous variables over which the local industry has no controlthe noise/disturbance in the systemand in which market price and competition are of importance.The long term health of the economy is a function of the long term trends (c.f. the future of the Guyanese industry with that of T&T), while the short term fluctuations, boom and bust phenomenon, are functions of the exogenous variable, the noise in the system.If we look at the long term trends we see that our oil production has declined steadily from some 240,000bbl per day to 60,000bbls per day currently.Further, the exploration for oil in the deep waters, where it will be more expensive to produce, has borne no fruit. The gas production needed to maintain the current industry is some four billion cubic feet per day. This has dropped and has remained below this figure for many years, with the petrochemical plants operating below capacity.Even the gas that exists is proving costly to NGC who is not purchasing all the gas available because of cost, so increasing the cost to the downstream producers: all of this is with global competition from US shale gas which is cheaper and abundant. Also, the deep water has given up some of its gas, but again the costs to produce will be high.The long term trends tell us that the local petroleum industry is in a creeping crisis of resource shortage and increasing exploration and production costs coupled with the threat of shale gas. Hence to judge the performance of this industry and therefore the countrys economy on the noise generated by the exogenous variables over a very short period (three quarters) really gives no indication of the economic health, growth or development of the industry or the economy as a whole.Surely, in the short term this crisis has to be dealt with as best we caninvestment encouragement, price negotiations with up and down-streamers. But if we focus exclusively on this crisis we will miss the strategic conditions that will make a fundamental contribution to our economic future. The world could even overlook us if we do not keep ourselves relevant to the global economy.A basic aspect of this relevance is that we must export, we must produce globally competitive goods/services so that we can fund the many key imports that cannot be made locally. The strategic conditions that govern how we reconstruct our economy are, not only that we must compete for space in the global market, but also respond to the disruptive digital technologies of the new industrial revolution. These technologies revolve around robotics, AIs deep learning and pattern recognition, and massive automation.What is emerging is that with these disruptive technologies the new currency is not capital, it is not money, it is data. Those who control this data will be the new robber barons  Google, Facebook, Amazon. These technologies are changing the way we do business, our business models, how we deliver services. They will destroy many conventional jobs, produce new ones but one fears that these new ones may not come fast enough.I have previously suggested the creation of a national innovation system as the way to go.It is unrealistic to ignore technological change and simply plan our diversification on traditional jobs and products of the past industrial paradigm. Seeking to import aluminium ingots to make wire and flat-plate is to short change our working population, or to service ships at La Brea whereas the expanding fibre optic networks that crisscross the oceans are the transport media for the new currency, data. To engage in building roads hoping that if the countryside is opened up this would spawn economic development is to ignore that the infrastructure that is really required is fibre optic networks to support the new data economy.If our government continues to gaze at its navel and ignore the need to so restructure our economy it will indeed be a dereliction of duty.

78^Brian Lara recently celebrated his 50th birthday. As we all continue to wish him the best, I wonder how many of us are aware that The Prince of Port of Spain was a national footballer before he was a national cricketer.Lara was a national under-14 player who represented our country at an invitational tournament in Puerto Rico. That team included Russell Latapy, captain, Dwight Yorke, Shaka Hislop, Ancil Elcock and Wayne De Bique.

79^One of my pet peeves is the lack of gratitude and courtesy displayed by many motorists and pedestrians on our nations roads.However, this hasnt deterred me from letting motorists out of side roads while in heavy traffic, or allowing persons to cross the road once it is safe to do so. On that note, I am happy to report that a few days ago my experience was very good, as the rastaman I let out from the side street next to Fatima College tooted his horn several times and raised his clenched fist as high as the heavens to indicate a warm thank you as he drove by.^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:19^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"The rastathe hopping ladythe garbage man

80^Reducing domestic violence requires adherence to facts rather than hyperbole. This is necessary because, as decades-old research on psychology (mainly in the field of public service messaging) has shown, human beings tend to follow whatever they perceive to be social norms.And the impression given by every single gender activist, psychologist, media commentator and letter-writer is that most men abuse women. This contradicts both experience and data. At any given time, a mere six to eight per cent of couples are in abusive relationships in Trinidad and Tobago (United Nations 2010 Report on Violence in the Caribbean).^undefined^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:22^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"When lesscan be more

82^"(BPT) - Playing video games is not simply entertainment or an escape for middle school girls; it can be a confidence booster. The best games offer intellectual challenges, social interaction and a creative outlet. These games provide opportunities for young women to problem solve, be part of a group, express themselves and find their voice.For many tween/teen girls, gaming can be a star with many points, says Taina Maln of Star Stable, an online multi-player PC game designed for Gen Z girls. For some, a game can be about storytelling and adventure; for some, its about caretaking; for some, its about hobbies; for some, its about sport and competition; for some, its about socializing. For all, its about self-expression  about simultaneously fitting in and standing out.Here are five features and characteristics to consider when choosing video games for a tween or teen girl:1) Find games that challenge her to think.Games involving problem-solving help girls feel a sense of accomplishment. When girls analyze a problem and resolve it successfully, it boosts their confidence. Many games today incorporate problem-solving as part of the adventure, such as multi-player games where girls work together to solve quests or challenges.2) Look for games that require collaboration and teamwork.Games that encourage or even require girls to work together help players hone their collaboration and communication skills, while creating a sense of community. In-game friendships (sometimes with players many states away) can expand the world around them. Games rooted in a positive, shared social experience and teamwork encourage collaboration and friendship.3) Choose games that mirror her interests.Todays tween girls have varied interests, and there are games that support virtually every pursuit  art, music, sports or animals. In addition to immersing themselves in a game subject they love, they are likely to find other girls with the same passion to ""nerd out"" about horses or soccer or fantastical worlds.4) Research games that encourage self-expression.Todays girl gamers tend to prefer open world or sandbox games that let them be creators, where they are customizing characters, building worlds or directing the plot. Girls at this age are in a constant battle to fit in and stand out. Games that allow a customized experience will not only give them a sense of control and decisiveness, but will also let them put their own unique stamp on their game experience  which can be very empowering.5) Select games rich in storytelling and music.Just like a favorite movie, todays games must also include a clever and interesting story, rich characters and original music. Tween/teen girls are sophisticated consumers, and an evolving story line and fresh music are markers for a game that is worthy of its cost. In many cases, game play can spill over to socializing, where girls talk plot and how it will unfold, the location of hidden gems or why they love a new song. A game like Star Stable can be the springboard for turning a gamer into a creator, where girls are inspired to make music videos, write poetry or produce artwork.These days, gaming is so much more than a simple pastime. It can be a place where girls connect with people with similar interests, grow friendships and express themselves. Helping them find the right game can reinforce their favorite interests and increase their self-confidence, and maybe even make those tween and teen years a tiny bit easier, and more fun."^Brandpoint (BPT)^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:28^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/39/b397ebfd-4304-5536-a452-1cc89957a9db/5cac3d438fb38.image.jpg?resize=400%2C225^"Video games that help young women solve problems and express themselves

83^May 17, 2019. Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Samsung is among the few companies that are primed for a hyper-connected, intelligent future. Through SmartThings solutions, Samsungs vision is to provide an open and seamless IoT experience with fewer boundaries. To that end, Samsung will enhance its ecosystem by opening its SmartThings Cloud to global partners, providing developers with easy-to-use SDKs, and expanding the availability of SmartThings to more devices.While the phrase the Fourth Industrial Revolution has yet to fully catch on with the general public, if you have been paying attention to consumer electronics news you likely have come across the excitement being generated by up-and-coming technologies, like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI).Industry pundits say 5G and AI are quintessential to ushering in Industry 4.0, which will fundamentally alter how people live and work. The future of hyper-connectedness, automation, and artificial intelligence, however, is not something that is light years away. People are already living this vision.Just look beneath the hood of your smart device. Smartphones nowadays are equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU) - an advanced microprocessor, dedicated to on-device AI-related tasks. This has led to improvements in the performance of smartphones with increased CPU/ GPU speeds, enhanced data security and battery life, among other things.Smart TVs are getting smarter, too. For instance, take Samsungs Quantum Processor 8K, the industrys first AI-powered picture processing engine, which can upscale content to appear in 8K quality regardless of the original source or format. Of course, to fully tap into the potential of 5G and AI, you need more than cuttingedge hardware; advancements in software and network solutions are equally critical.Samsung can attest to the importance of versatility. Samsung is uniquely positioned, with its diverse product portfolio and business scale to bring to life a truly connected.A Day for TelecommunicationWorld Telecommunication Day (WTD) has been celebrated annually on 17 May since 1969. The date marks the anniversary of the founding of ITU on 17 May 1865, when the first International Telegraph Convention was signed in Paris.With the growth in importance of information technology alongside telecommunications  especially the Internet  it was recognised that the topic also needed to be brought to public attention. The aim of this day is to focus on the importance of these technologies and the wide range of related social and economic issues.When you combine the half-a-billion devices that Samsung sells every year and its leadership in semiconductors, displays, TVs and home appliances, the 50-year-old electronics giant says it has a deeper understanding and insight over how consumers interact with its devices. Combining its multiple consumer touchpoints, it has an opportunity to truly enrich peoples experiences and interactions with technology.^Media Release^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:30^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==^"How Samsung is Bracing Itself for the Latest Industrial Revolution

84^A 62-year-old employee of funeral home, is expected to appear before a Port of Spain Magistrate today, after being arrested and charged for drug trafficking.Thomas Pena, of Port of Spain, was detained by officers of the InterAgency Task Force (IATF) around 2:30pm on Thursday.While executing a search warrant at the funeral home, officers allegedly found a black plastic bag containing 405 grammes of marijuana in Penas locker.Further searches revealed an additional 600 grammes of compressed marijuana hidden in the mortuary area of the home, police say.Pena was later charged by PC Agostini, of the IATF, for the offence of possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.In a separate incident, officers carried out a search at one of the apartment buildings at the Harpe Place Plannings. There, they found 371 grammes of marijuana along with a Smith and Wesson revolver loaded with five rounds of ammunition, under the building.^undefined^"

85^Why did NALIS issue a memo to staff asking them to bring their own toilet paper and water because of a shortage of funds, when it the organisation has $26 million in its bank account?Its a question Government is now seeking answers to.The issue was raised in the House of Representatives today.Responding to questions by Opposition MP Ramona Ramdial, Planning Minister Camille Robinson Regis described the memo as disturbing and said it may have been ill-advised.Asked to confirm whether NALIS has sufficient funds to purchase water and toilet paper for staff, Robinson Regis responded:Our information is that NALIs does have an account with $26 million in it. And as a consequence of that, we find it quite curious that such a memo would have been authored, and we are very concerned about that. We are trusting that it was not politically motivated, especially given the fact that our information is that the memo was also sent to Devant Maharaj.She said immediately after Communications Minister Stuart Young, who is out of the country, got wind of the memo, he requested that the Ministrys Permanent Secretary make an official inquiry as to its authenticity.Robinson Regis said neither the Permanent Secretary nor the Minister were apprised of the any situation warranting the memo.The preliminary report that has been received suggests that this memo may have been ill-advised and the Minister has requested the provision of documentation surrounding the existence of money which NALIS has in its possession, which will negate the effect of the content of the memo. It appears that the executive director was ill-advised to author such a memo, she said.On Tuesday, NALIS executive director issued a memo to staff telling them that due to a shortage of funds, NALIS was experiencing challenges in maintaining its operations.She said as a result of the guava season that befell the organisation, it had to make adjustments in two areas.Currently, NALIS spends $6552 per month for the purchase of water. Effective Monday June 3, 2019, NALIS will no longer be purchasing bottled water, and staff are being asked to supply their own until further notice, she urged.She said NALIS will continue to purchase toilet paper and hand tissue once funds were available, however, given the funding realities and the fact that these items ran short on Tuesday, staff are advised to bring some for their personal use should NALIS supplies again fall short.^Leah Sorias^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:36^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/d0/3d0e5db6-78d8-11e9-90d1-d397e61c4fc5/5cdf088ce2e91.image.jpg?resize=400%2C148^"$26m bank accountBut workers told bring own toilet paperwater

87^POLICE from water provider WASA seized two pumps and four hoses from a Bon Air Gardens, Arouca, farmer yesterday.Nandlal Jadoo, 64, told the Express that around 5 p.m. yesterday, three men came in a marked Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) vehicle and seized two pumps and the hoses from a spring adjacent to the land he says he has been farming on since the late 1980s.He said he grows celery, sweet peppers, melongene, pimentos and corn.Last Saturday, WASA police seized equipment from farmers in Aranjuez.Jadoo recalled in the late 1980s, the then-National Housing Authority was building houses near their crops, and there was a spring beneath the roadway.He said with the help of the contractor, they were able to lay a six-inch PVC pipe below the road to capture spring water to use on their crops.He said this spring is used by other farmers around him as well.A WASA official said yesterday that if someone is extracting water from a river or spring in Trinidad and Tobago, they needed to have a lease in place.Farmers going to courtThe seizure of Jadoos equipment comes as Aranjuez farmers plan go to court next week Wednesday to face charges of illegally abstracting water from a watercourse to irrigate their crops.The farmers, whose equipment was seized by WASA police on Saturday, held a meeting on Wednesday night to discuss the matter.Spokesman for the farmers Pt Satyanand Maharaj said more than 150 farmers attended the meeting, which lasted some three hours.He argued the seizure of the farmers equipment was illegal and unlawful.Maharaj said: Issues discussed ranged from best practice in following established codes in water abstraction, as well as the rights of farmers. Many topics that centred around land tenure and cultivation practices, as well as the failures and incompetence of the Minister of Public Utilities, who has done irreparable damage to the image of Aranjuez farmers.Maharaj said some of the farmers expressed fear they were being targeted because of their race and perceived political affiliation with the United National Congress (UNC) party.Others felt they were being driven off their lands so the Government can build houses.Maharaj made a call for all farmers to attend the court hearing in a show of solidarity.He said the farmers will not bow to pressure from the Government.The farmers are being represented in the court matter by attorneys Stefan Ramkissoon, Jagdeo Singh and Keil Tacklalsingh.^Camille Hunte^"

88^(BPT) - Home is supposed to be a safe space, so it can be scary to think about things like fires. Unfortunately, fires are a real threat. Seven people die each day due to home fires, so it's important to be ready.Every home needs working smoke alarms and an escape plan for exiting the house. These are essential first steps, but there is an additional tool that dramatically reduces the spread of home fires, and the risk of dying from one: installing home fire sprinklers.Home fire sprinklers save livesYou probably see fire sprinklers in commercial places all the time; maybe where you work or at your favorite stores. These systems are an effective method for controlling fires quickly. Theyre less common in homes, but they work there just as well.The risk of dying in a home fire decreases by about 85 percent if sprinklers are present. Research shows when sprinklers were present, fires were kept to the room of origin 97 percent of the time. That means the sprinkler activates and puts out the fire before it has a chance to spread to other places in the home. The National Fire Protection Association and the Home Fire Sprinkler Coalition want you to know these facts:Only one sprinkler activates: If a fire starts, the closest sprinkler will activate, spraying water to control the flames, heat and deadly smoke. That fast control gives you time to escape to safety. In most cases, just one sprinkler is needed.Fire sprinklers use less water than fire hoses: When a sprinkler activates, it flows at a rate of 10-26 gallons of water per minute  a fraction of the water that fire hoses use. Because of the sprinklers fast action and less water flow, the property loss in a sprinklered home fire is far less than in an unsprinklered home fire.Home fires are deadly in 2 minutes or less: It takes 9-12 minutes or more for a fire department to get notification, respond and begin suppression. In that time, an uncontrolled fire will grow and spread through the home, becoming potentially deadly in 2 minutes or less. A sprinkler controls the fire before it can spread, protecting residents and the responding firefighters.Smoke alarms are not enough: Working smoke alarms are essential in every home. But they can only detect a fire, not fight it. Fire sprinklers detect the fire and automatically control it, saving lives and property.Sprinklers are reliable and easy to maintain: Fire sprinkler mishaps are generally less likely and less severe than home plumbing system problems. For regions subject to freezing temperatures, proper installation eliminates worries. Maintenance is simple.Take action now: Test your smoke alarms and practice your escape plan with your family. If you are thinking of building or buying a home, ask for fire sprinklers. They provide peace of mind, protecting you and your family should you ever face the threat of a home fire.

89^(BPT) - Congratulations, college graduates! Youre all set to enter the job market, but do you have what it takes to get to and from interviews or work? It might be time to move on from worn-out, hand-me-down vehicles for your fresh start in life.Safety ratings and affordability are important considerations when it comes to purchasing a vehicle, but you should also know that youll need to budget for additional costs in your monthly expenses once you become an owner, said The Complete Idiots Guide to Buying or Leasing a Car author Jack R. Nerad.Buying a car doesnt have to break the bank, and grads should factor insurance, fuel and maintenance costs into their purchase decision.Here are four things to consider when shopping for a car.1. Vehicle safetyVehicle safety ratings are evaluated based on crashworthiness and crash preventability.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a 5-Star Ratings program, with more stars meaning the vehicle is safer, while the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) tests vehicles for crashworthiness, and crash avoidance and mitigation.I recommend looking at both the IIHS and NHTSA ratings to identify vehicles that are crashworthy and, importantly, have equipment that will help drivers avoid a crash, which is preferable to surviving one, said Nerad.Many modern vehicles are equipped with Adaptive Driver Assistance Systems like lane departure warning, blind spot information systems, and braking assistance technology to help prevent a collision or lessen its severity.2. Insurance costsInsurance should be top-of-mind when picking a car because itll protect you and your vehicle. Its role in the shopping process is two-fold: it can give you a sense of your monthly premium based on the car you select and it also lets you find the right company for your insurance needs ahead of making either purchase.Younger drivers generally have higher premiums because of their inexperience, and statistics show that driving experience has a significant impact on accidents, said Mercury Insurance Chief Claims Officer Randy Petro. We recommend that you speak with an insurance agent to help ensure you get the right amount of coverage at the best possible rate.Mercury recently examined model-year 2015-2018 vehicles with high ratings from NHTSA and IIHS to compile a top-10 list of the most affordable vehicles to insure for college grads. The list is based on a national average of the price for full coverage, but other factors can push that rate up or down. The 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe ranked first, while other Hyundai models, Kias and Hondas also made the list.3. Fuel economyFuel is a recurring expense for vehicle owners. A tip to determine how much itll cost each month is to factor in the size of the vehicles fuel tank, average miles driven and gas prices. Speeding, rapidly accelerating or braking aggressively burn through fuel at a faster rate, so its best to follow the speed limit and stay away from aggressive driving behaviors to save money on gas.4. Maintenance and repairsVehicle ownership includes being financially responsible for wear-and-tear and general maintenance, like oil changes, and tire and brake replacement. Owners manuals provide information about recommended services and frequency, and many are available online to help with your car-buying research.Its a good idea to start a repair fund early on to protect against potential rainy day blues once the manufacturers warranty expires.An extended warranty, like Mercurys Mechanical Protection plans, helps extend the life of a vehicle for up to seven years or 100,000 miles, said Nerad. This is something to consider to help cover the cost to repair your vehicle if it breaks down.Finding a safe, reliable vehicle will keep you moving forward in lifes journey, and these tips will help make it more affordable. Good luck, and enjoy the journey!^Brandpoint (BPT)^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:47^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/70/e704f790-1e39-54bd-ae67-dcde1772b80a/5cdfa6cfe02a6.image.jpg?resize=400%2C225^"4 tips to help college grads buy the perfect vehicle

91^(BPT) - If youve been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), youre far from alone.The inflammatory disease affects some 1.3 million adults in America, according to the National Institutes of Health.1,2Whats more, despite recent advances in treatments for the disease, many patients still experience ongoing, disruptive and often very painful symptoms.RA patient Catherine M. has learned to cope with RA by gaining a realistic understanding about what it means to have an autoimmune disease  what it can do to my body and how it impacts my life. Its all about balance, acceptance, and perseverance.Catherine has also learned to listen to her body and work with her RA healthcare team when her symptoms persist. If you are currently on treatment for your RA and your symptoms are still interfering with your daily life, your RA may not be well controlled. Consider scheduling an appointment with your RA healthcare team to discuss your symptoms and signs and learn what other options may exist to help you break out of the cycle of pain, fatigue and stiffness.Unrelieved joint pain and swelling. You may feel pain or stiffness, or notice puffiness, redness or warmth around your extremities (like your fingers, toes, wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and/or shoulders). Its especially important to talk to your healthcare team if any of these symptoms are keeping you from carrying on with your daily activities.Morning stiffness. The early morning hours can be worse for people with RA who may experience more pain or stiffness after sleeping.3 If you notice that your RA-related pain is particularly debilitating or lasts longer than usual, its worth noting to your healthcare team.Whole-body symptoms. RA can affect your body, beyond just your joints. Some patients experience whole-body symptoms such as fatigue, muscle aches or a feeling of bad all over, which some doctors call malaise. Left uncontrolled, these symptoms can take both a mental and physical toll on your body as a whole.One of them is elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a substance associated with inflammation produced in the liver in response to RA and other illnesses. High levels may indicate your RA inflammation is not being controlled by your current treatment.As Catherine says, Its important to have a really open communication about what your needs are and what goals you want to set for yourself. If your RA symptoms persist and impact your ability to do daily activities, its time to get ready to act, and talk with your healthcare team about other available treatment options.References:SAUS.SARI.19.04.2689 05/2019^Brandpoint (BPT)^undefined^2019-05-20 19:01:55^data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mM8U8+AFzCOKgADAHdUC60wg0dkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC^"4 signssymptoms which may mean your rheumatoid arthritis is uncontrolled

92^The last thing anyone wants is to have to visit a sick relative or friend at a hospital and fight for a parking space.That is exactly what happens at the San Fernando General Hospital, and members of the public are not happy.For several months, citizens have been using social media to express disgust and frustration over the lack of adequate parking facilities at what is the largest hospital in the country.One visitor said: The health care amongst everything else in this country is so deplorable its unbelievable. Staff has parking from both the front and back and imagine coming to the hospital and most of the times the car park half empty, and yet citizens whose hard earned money is paying for these simple amenities have to suffer and being treated like we dont have any rights in this country.... Trinidad is not ah real place.The San Fernando General HospitalAnother aggrieved person said: So when citizens visit San Fernando General Hospital we are expected to find a park somewhere far or travel to the hospital? Every car park near the hospital seem to be for staff. Not everyone can walk to get to the hospital. By now we should have a multi-level car park at the back near emergency and casualty.On a regular basis theres chaos and frayed emotions, further compounded by discourteous security personnel at the hospital, one visitor said.Car park chaosThe Express visited the hospital during the day several times over the past few weeks and found mayhem.Trying to navigate in and out of the parking area at the hospital is like putting together a complicated puzzle. Be prepared. It is going to take awhile. The space allotted for the public is too small, so people are parking their cars haphazardly, said a motorist who spoke with the Express.The Express witnessed a stand-off between the security personnel and a woman who brought her sick relative to the hospital.Tempers flared as other motorists in the car park began shouting back and forth with security.The heated exchange was due to limited parking, motorists said.The woman, who requested that her name not be used, said she arrived at the hospital around 10 a.m with her sick relative. Two hours later, she was ready to take her relative home but couldnt as two cars were blocking her in.She said: I have been waiting here for a half an hour and I cant come out. Im blocked in. I spoke to security but they are no help. This is so frustrating. Every time you come here, its the same thing, chaos!A man who came to pick up his wife at the hospital told the Express that parking at the hospital is so horrendous, he doesnt even want to take a chance to park at the facility.He said: My wife is sick. She cant walk long distances and yet I still have to ask her to walk by the security booth and sit down so I could come and pick her up. I utilise parking around the hospital to avoid the chaos inside the car park because it is too far for my wife to walk.Parking cultureMayor of San Fernando Junia Regrello said he never had to go to San Fernando General Hospital to seek treatment nor had he had to take a loved one to institution so he could not comment directly with regard to the parking situation at the facility.The Emergency Department of the San Fernando General Hospital. Photo: DEXTER PHILIPHe said there was sufficient parking in and around the hospital for the public, but there needs to be a culture shift.We have a culture here where we want to park outside the places that we are going to. There are several parking spots around San Fernando where you can pay a small fee for parking. We have just recently improved parking on the promenade and provided additional parking on the promenade, Regrello said.There is additional parking on Lady Hailes Avenue, there is a car park at the City entrance, and there is a long term plan by UDeCOTT to put up a multi-storey car park in the same area, he said.Patients unable or unwilling to pay the small fee to park outside the hospital must face the parking challenges inside San Fernando General Hospital compound.I didnt knowIn a telephone interview with the Trinidad Express on Thursday, chief executive officer of South West Regional Health Authority, Keith McDonald said he was not aware there was an issue with parking at the facility.Despite citizens over the course of several weeks using social media to express their dissatisfaction over the parking facilities at the hospital, McDonald said he received no reports on the issue.On Wednesday, another citizen posted a video about his experience at the hospital.The following comment was posted along with the video.San Fernando Teaching Hospital. reach here 6am with my wife for clinic. Was told by the guards the car park is full. Had to go an find parking elsewhere. Somebody needs to look into this an put proper management here...this is total BS!The video which runs less than 30 seconds has the man explaining that he had to look for parking elsewhere after he was told by security personnel at the hospital the car park was full.In the video, the car park appeared almost empty.Told by the Express about the mans issue, McDonald said, The person should call me so I can look into it because I am not aware of it.The Express brought it to the attention of McDonald that it is not just one person with this grievance, but thousands of people frustrated over the lack of adequate parking at the hospital.He said, Can you ask them to call me?With the regards to an area cordoned off with yellow tape around by Casualty and Emergency at the hospital that was once utilised by the public but now restricted, McDonald said, Let me get to the bottom of this. I wasnt aware there was a problem there.^Kimoy Leon Sing^"

94^A LOPINOT man suspected in the stabbing of a primary school teacher in her classroom in Arouca on Monday, has gone into hiding.The 26-year-old suspect ran out of St Pius Boys RC Primary School and has not been found by police officers since.The suspect attacked Norma Maharaj, 45, while she taught her Standard Two class around 2 p.m.Maharajs daughter, Anuskha Maharaj, told the Express yesterday that the suspect was known to her family.He went to her school asking her for money for some pieces of steel he had put on the land about five years ago. She told him she cant talk right now because class was in session, but meet her home later and they will discuss it. He told her he was going to kill her, and began stabbing her, said the daughter.Anushka Maharaj said the man and his family occupy her parents land at La Pastora in Lopinot and they had been in dispute for years over the occupancy.Maharaj was stabbed five timestwo in her back and three times in her chest. Both of her lungs were punctured, said the daughter.She is in a lot of pain with every breath. She has to lie on her back on the bed, on the stab wounds, which is very painful for her, she said.Maharaj is a mother of two and a grandmother of one. She has been a teacher for more than ten years.Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TTUTA) has appealed for increased security at primary schools.And the Association of Denominational Boards of Education has condemned the attack on the teacher. According to a news release from the association, this was the second such attack of school personnel within a four-month period this year. The first incident took place in February, when the principal of Tunapuna Hindu School was assaulted on the school compound.In a statement issued yesterday, the association said it strongly upheld the right of staff and students for a safe and secure environment.The Ministry of Education is responsible for the provision of security services in public primary schools, both government and denominational. The Ministry provides these services through the National Maintenance Training and Security Company Limited (MTS), the statement said.The recent events in schools have drawn attention to the possible need for additional security personnel to facilitate escort of visitors on the premises. We reiterate this observation and once again request that the Minister and staff review the existing security arrangements and provide the resources necessary to ensure the safety and security of all persons within the school compound as well as that of the physical plant, the statement added.^Susan Mohammed^"

96^(BPT) - Fathers Day is a time to show Dad appreciation for all he does, big and small. This year, get him something more exciting than the traditional tie, golf gear or barbecue accessories.In general, dads can never have enough tools, and depending on your dads personality and what he likes to do, there's always something that will rev his engine. This tool guide will give you the insight you need to get him something that he'll truly appreciate this Father's Day.For the tech lover:Give him something that will keep the lawn looking great and save him time. With a Husqvarna Automower robotic lawn mower, he can sit back, sip his favorite beverage and watch it in wonder! He won't have to lift a finger all summer long to get a lawn that's the envy of the neighborhood, plus he can brag about the robot mower to the guys. The Automower 115H already includes professional installation, so Dad can take all the credit without any of the work.For the green guy:Does Dad have a thing for Mother Nature? If he wants to go green while keeping his green lawn looking great, consider gifting him a battery-powered weed trimmer. They are strong, remarkably silent and nearly vibration-free. Keep in mind when shopping, curved shaft trimmers are lighter and great for trimming smaller lawns and flowerbeds. Straight shaft trimmers with bevel gears are designed for bigger jobs and can reach under hedges, bushes and fences.For the power hungry:If Dad likes power, nothing is more exciting than a brand-new chainsaw. Consider getting him an easy-to-start and simple-to-use smart chainsaw that is perfect for any season. The all-new Husqvarna 130 chainsaw is gas-powered yet designed for low fuel consumption. It is ideal for light tasks like shrub pruning, tree felling or cutting firewood.For the new homeowner:If he just moved into a new home, he's probably building up his tool collection. Basic essentials are sure to be appreciated. Consider building him a toolbox with all the basics needed for minor household tasks. A hammer, screwdrivers, wrenches, a tape measure, nails and screws will come in handy for years to come. Want to go bigger? Get him a ladder or rechargeable drill.For the laid-back cruiser:If your dad has a larger yard and likes to get the job done himself, consider going big and gifting him a riding lawn mower or lawn tractor to cruise through his yard work. When choosing a rider, be sure to select a versatile model with the right-sized cutting deck. Husqvarna riding lawn mowers are equipped with the ability to side discharge, mulch or bag and can be fitted with a variety of accessories from a trailer to a spreader to a two-stage snow blower.For the neat freak:For the dad who is always taking care of messes, consider a leaf blower that will allow him to power through any job. Handheld leaf blowers are typically lightweight and easier to maneuver into tight spaces, making them ideal for light-duty yard projects. Backpack leaf blowers provide the extra power and air speed to clear leaves, sand, gravel and other debris.For the gadget guy:There is no shortage of great gadgets for Dad this Father's Day. From multi-use tools that fit right in his pocket to laser stud finders that make it easy to find studs in the wall, you can't go wrong with gadget gifts. For the outdoors, consider gifting him a garden camera so that he can see all the critters that come into the yard day and night.Finding the right gift for your dad this Fathers Day doesnt have to be a shot in the dark. From gadget guys to power lovers, theres a tool out there for every dad.^Brandpoint (BPT)^undefined^2019-05-20 19:02:10^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/fe/4fe7448d-91eb-537b-ae49-2b4266e8e445/5cdfa6c2ed97f.image.jpg?resize=400%2C225^"Terrific toolsA Fathers Day gift guide

99^(BPT) - Elissa Reynolds was preparing to move to Indianapolis and begin an exciting new chapter in her life. Knowing her upcoming move meant she would be without health insurance for a time, the 36-year-old decided to get any potential health issues examined while she still had coverage.After experiencing dizziness and a rapid heart rate, Reynolds visited Northeast Georgia Medical Center in Gainesville, Georgia, where scans of her lungs revealed pulmonary emboli  blockages in her lung arteries. Doctors determined they were a secondary effect of an unknown cancer that had started in her colon and spread to her liver. Having displayed no cancer symptoms, Reynolds was shocked by a stage four colorectal cancer diagnosis.It was a strange conversation with my doctors, Reynolds says. But I was determined to do whatever it took to beat cancer, so I began researching all of the treatment options I could.World-class care in her communityAt first, Reynolds mother was adamant that she travel to a large cancer care center in a major city for treatment. However, her research led her to realize she could receive cutting-edge care close to home.Meeting my oncologist, Dr. Christina Saurel, and surgeon, Dr. Ken Dixon, gave me a whole new perspective on the level of innovative care I could receive locally, she says.While Reynolds and her health care team initially embarked on a traditional chemotherapy course, due to the advanced nature of her cancer, they also considered other options.Because Elissa presented with an advanced colon cancer that had spread to her liver, we were uncertain of her care and had to think outside the box, Saurel says. Although one of her tumors responded to chemotherapy and shrank to the point Dr. Dixon could remove it, the other tumor did not, which meant we had to get creative.A new option for personalized treatmentThankfully, Reynolds had other options to consider because Dixon did something many cancer surgeons dont  after removing her tumor, he preserved her living tumor tissue and shipped it to a state-of-the-art laboratory, where specialists tested the cells with more than 130 drugs to see what potential future treatments would be most effective.Dixon understands no two cancers are the same, and he knew that her living tumor sample could offer information on how to treat her unique cancer that a traditional tissue sample could not. He feels so strongly about this matter that he founded SpeciCare, an organization dedicated to helping patients across the country preserve their living tumor tissue for their own benefit.Under current practice guidelines, cancer tissue dies when it is removed, which limits the information it can provide, Dixon says. However, if a tumor is preserved alive and tested, it has the power to unlock the secret to personalized care. SpeciCare links research, clinical care and precision medicine, so patients have the greatest chance at survival.Hope for the futureThe tests on Reynolds living tumor tissue found 20 new treatment options for her care team to consider that likely would have remained unknown if Dixon had not preserved her tumor. In fact, none of the new therapy options revealed through the tests are commonly used for metastatic colorectal cancer; traditionally, they are prescribed for other cancers, such as leukemia and breast cancer.Cancer is very tricky  you cant always predict how a persons unique cancer will react to a drug based on its location, says Dixon.For Reynolds, it doesn't matter how the drugs are normally used; her only concern is whether they kill her tumor cells. Now, because of the new treatment options available to her, Reynolds knows that if her cancer stops responding to one drug, there are other therapies she can try. Also, her living tumor tissue tests helped identify two clinical trials she can pursue.Without SpeciCare there would be no more options for me; Id be living with the tumor. Now this is giving me hope of shrinking it and having it removed, Reynolds says. This has opened up so many more options for treatment. Its been a crazy journey, but its also been pretty miraculous.To learn more, visit specicare.com/hope or call 833-242-2873.^Brandpoint (BPT)^undefined^2019-05-20 19:02:20^https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/4a/f4a3792d-0ccd-5625-bc1b-dae1d0c185e0/5cdfa6cbd37af.image.jpg?resize=400%2C225^"Personalized cancer care offers new hope for patients
